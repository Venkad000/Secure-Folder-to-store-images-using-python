# Secure-Folder-to-store-images-using-python
A program that saves images in encrypted format with each image having its own encryption key using python

Abstract:
      Images are very sensitive data and we need to make sure that they are stored safely and most of the time, we need some kind of app that encrypts the image and doesnot allow directly viewing the images. That is why we have come up with this as the idea for the project. This app that has a Graphical User Interface that is built using pythonâ€™s Tkinter , allows to have multiple users and the users can store their images with a encryption key. This encryption key needs to be entered everytime they try to access the image. The image will temporarily get decrypted while the user is viewing the image, and get encrypted back one the user closes the image. Every single image has its own encryption key. This way, the user can be assured that the other images stored will not be compromised even if the encryption key for a single image was found out. More over, the back end is an API can be fexibly used for a lot of purposes and can be customized according to your needs by just modifying a few lines of code. Images can be very fun if a few filters are added to them, and hence we have an option for that too. From this project, we hope to build a app that can safely save encrypted images.
